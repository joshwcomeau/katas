#Weekly Challenges

Started as a way to exercise my brain and have fun, I'll be solving a programming challenge every week for 10 weeks, starting on August 1. This process is documented on [my Medium blog](https://medium.com/@joshuawcomeau).

###Problem 1: Largest 5-digit consecutive number in a sequence  
This straight-forward math/programming challenge from CodeWars asks you to find the largest 5-digit number in a series. For example, the largest 2-digit number in '19285' is 92.

###Problem 2: LRU Cache
Also from CodeWars, this problem asks you to create a Least-Recently-Used cache. It's an incredibly enlightening exercise; `Object.defineProperty` is amazing.
