#Coding Challenges

One of my favorite pastimes is solving short, concise programming problems. This repo is a collection of such problems, sourced from sites like [Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). The solutions are documented in detail on [my Medium blog](https://medium.com/@joshuawcomeau).

###Problem 1: Moving Window
This straight-forward math/programming challenge from CodeWars asks you to find the largest 5-digit number in a series. For example, the largest 2-digit number in `19285` is 92.

###Problem 2: LRU Cache
Also from CodeWars, this problem asks you to create a Least-Recently-Used cache. It's an incredibly enlightening exercise; `Object.defineProperty` is amazing.

###Problem 3: Happy Numbers
From Project Euler, this problem is much more math-focused, and asks you to calculate how many 'unhappy' numbers there are below 10 million.

###Problem 4: Sudoku Validation
From CodeWars, this is a simple problem: Write a script that will validate a Sudoku, passed in as a 2D array of numbers. It takes some inspiration from functional programming, in the form of avoiding side effects, not mutating data, and using short, single-purpose functions.

###Problem 5: Dependency Injection
A homegrown mini framework for handling dependencies with dependency injection. Turns out it's pretty straightforward!
